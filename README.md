# Heart-disease-ML
We use Keras and Scikit-learn to create and train a neural network that can predict heart disease and comparing it with classical machine learning classification models.

The dataset can be found in:
http:////archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

The dataset contains 76 attributes, among which we find age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, echocardiogram data, exercise habits. However, all published studies using this data focus on a subset of 14 attributes, and so will we. In particular, we will use the processed data collected at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
